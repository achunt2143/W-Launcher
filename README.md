* Placeholder image for dock background is currently being used until there is a suitable
  replacement

* App drawer separation of system and downloaded apps
* Settings in app drawer
* Allow dock to be customizable
* Do better on the dock layout

## Commit History

8/23/2022 Fixed a weird bug where launching phone when Samsung Level app is installed will launch
that instead of dialer. On press of home button now works to take user to home screen. Dock
background has been changed for debug purposes. This will be changed later.

8/19/2022 Some animations and layout issued have been adjusted. Dock icons now launch and close
appropriately. Some testing may need to be done on this still. Dock background may need to be
changed. App launcher will probably need to be its own activity moving forward to do some of the set
goals. App drawer is now the only issue.

8/13/2022 Added animations, fixed some formating issues with icons, sorting apps alphabetically

8/12/2022 Project pushed to Github and all functions work

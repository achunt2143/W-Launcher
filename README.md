# webOS-Launcher
This is an attemp to create a launcher based on webOS. The shortcuts will launch your default applications.

## Known bugs
* App drawer is a little slow to launch on first open
* When launching an app from the dock, the home button will only take you home if you launch phone or browser. Messages and contacts require back button to go home

## Future Tasks
* Adding the Just Type... functionality
* App drawer separation of system and downloaded apps
* Settings in app drawer
* Allow dock to be customizable
* Do better on the dock layout

## Commit History

Some animations and layout issued have been adjusted. Dock icons now launch and close appropriately. Some testing may need to be done on this still. Dock background may need to be changed. App launcher will probably need to be its own activity moving forward to do some of the set goals.
